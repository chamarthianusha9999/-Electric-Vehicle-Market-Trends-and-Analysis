Electric Vehicle Market Trends and Analysis" project, the focus was on understanding the evolving landscape of the electric vehicle (EV) market. The project involved collecting and aggregating data from various sources, including vehicle registration databases, sales reports, and market research studies. Through rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing, inconsistencies and inaccuracies were addressed to ensure reliable and actionable insights.

Data processing and analysis were then conducted to identify key market trends, such as the growth rate of EV adoption, regional differences in EV popularity, and the impact of government incentives on EV sales. The project also explored consumer behavior and preferences, including popular EV models, electric range, and price sensitivity.

Finally, a comprehensive report was generated, featuring visualizations and dashboards that presented these insights in a clear and accessible manner. This report was designed to support strategic decision-making for stakeholders in the automotive industry, helping them navigate the rapidly changing EV market and make informed investment and marketing decisions.
